Attax.js
========

This is  a mini jQuery-like JavaScript  library.I create it for  JavaScript freshmen and  showing  how to create a JavaScript library one step by one step.

Attax.js major in DOM Operating.It contains some basic methods to help you create some pages effect.But I create attax.js for JavaScript freshmen and help them learn JavaScript by create a Library by themselves. so,as we know ,my JavaScript actually is shit,but I am so happy to help others.
Attax.js's selector engineer is called "Selector.js" like "Sizzle.js" of the jQuery's select enginner.But the "Selector.js" is just a basic selector,and it is not  enough good like "Sizzle.js".
